# BigSpark Java data Project
This project is a playground to learn spark, and program
in a cluster environment on HDFS. The end product is going to
integrate an embedded app API that displays graphical
information based on the algorithms I develop in Java on
the backend spark API. Hopefully I can learn some
Spark SQL as well. I have no idea how this will work out.
